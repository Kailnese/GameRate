All worlds but the final one include a mausoleum where the player has to parry ghosts before they touch an urn which rewards them with a Super move for completing the challenge. Each of these boss fights and run-and-gun levels is housed in one of four different worlds, with the fourth world containing the final fight against the Devil himself. Each boss fight includes a simple, normal and expert difficulty mode"
